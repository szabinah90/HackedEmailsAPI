# Hacked-Emails API communicating with ElasticSearch

This program is using the Hacked-Emails API to gather data about e-mail address leaks for analytical purposes.

It communicates with an ElasticSearch cluster:
Checks if a queried address exists under the index, and uploads it (with the associated data) or updates the document, respectively.

Issue:
In accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Hacked-Emails API is no longer available, so this code is no longer able to fulfill its purpose.
